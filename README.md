This guide is a DSi Homebrew guide that allows you to go from stock firmware to HiyaCFW, a type of custom firmware.
This is a guide for anyone that would like to have easy-to-follow instructions that they can understand, unlike other, more complicated guides.
We are not associated with any guide that is "forked" from our guide, and we don't reccomend that you follow those unless you can confirm that the source is legitimate.
